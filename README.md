## Email Hosting
for custom domains
* [Yandex.Mail](https://connect.yandex.com/pdd/#!organizations): probably the best option and closes to Google Apps but **free** :heart:
  * Here's an amazing [guide](https://help.alidropship.com/improve-your-store/creating-a-branded-business-email-with-yandex) on how to set it up.
* [ZOHO Mail](): 5 free accounts, great control and interface, but **no POP or IMAP support**
* [Google Apps](): probably the best alternative if the budget allows; but won't work in China
* [Migadu](https://www.migadu.com/en/pricing.html): a Swiss option, that's low cost and also comes with a free option with a catch or two
* [bitrix24](https://www.bitrix24.com/): seems like a good and free service I stumbled upon in a google search but need to look closer
